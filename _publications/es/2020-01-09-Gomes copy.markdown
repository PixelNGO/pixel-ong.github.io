asbtract: "In this work we present an innovative and low-cost way to estimate the dielectric constant of real soils -which is relatedto soil moisture- using GPS satellite signal. The trajectory of the satellites was followed with an automated device,and with an antenna type patch was measured the interference pattern generated by the direct GPS signal and thatreflected by the ground. To analyze the acquired signal, an electromagnetic dispersion model based on the methodof small perturbation was used, which may include stratifications in the underground and from which the dielectricconstant that best fits the measurements was obtained. These values were compared with the obtained using a sensorthat measures the soil dielectric constant  textit in-situ. The comparisons show that the method based on the interferencepattern provides satisfactory results to estimate the dielectric constant of real bare soils. Finally, proposals are outlinedto improve the results obtained in this work."
