asbtract: "Soil moisture (SM) retrieval using signals of opportunity based on specularly reflected signals has gained significant attention in the past two decades. Specifically, with the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CyGNSS), the reflected signal is often modeled in its simplest form, utilizing the Fresnel reflection coefficients for a semi-infinite dielectric medium corrected with an effective roughness parameter. Within this framework, for bare soils condition, only two parameters need to be inferred: the dielectric permittivity ε (related to SM) and the effective roughness σ. Although this approach is relatively simple, our results show that both the estimated dielectric constant and the modeled reflectivity consistently overestimate CyGNSS observations. To address these overestimations, we propose a model where the reflected signal is scattered by a medium comprising two layers: one with a finite thickness d and permittivity ε1 and the other semi-infinite with permittivity ε2. We observe that both the in-situ measurements of ε1 and the reflectivity reported by CyGNSS align with the optimal values obtained from the fit, resulting in a 73% reduction in root mean square error when compared to the traditional approach. To further enhance SM retrieval, we propose incorporating full polarimetric images from SAOCOM. This will allow us to combine the low revisit time of CyGNSS with the high spatial resolution offered by SAOCOM."

# In recent years, in addition to the traditional uses of forest plantations, there has been an interest in their capacity to capture and fix carbon in their structures, acting as greenhouse gas sinks. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) project features a light detection and ranging sensor aimed at quantifying the distribution of biomass and carbon in woody vegetation worldwide. Although the GEDI level 4A product (L4A) generates aboveground biomass density (AGBD) estimates on a global scale using semi-empirical relationships between the energy reflected at a given height (rh metric) and AGBD, its forest segmentation is coarse and presents limitations at a local scale, which can result in less accurate estimates. We evaluated the accuracy of GEDI L4A AGBD estimates and in situ AGBD data obtained from forest inventories. The analysis of the relationship between in situ AGBD and GEDI L4A product AGBD estimates shows that, although the correlation is generally good, some plots exhibit high variability in GEDI AGBD values despite having intermediate values of in situ AGBD [root mean squared error (RMSE) = 89.1 Mg/h]. Moreover, we found that these underestimations are associated with low values of rh<sub>50</sub>. In particular, these low values of rh<sub>50</sub> (related to large AGBD RMSE errors) were not related to thinned/non-thinned forests but were related to understory conditions (less error for the “very dense” understories). Then, we explored landcover misassignment; as the Pinus sp. plantations correspond to implanted North American evergreen needleleaf forests (ENFs), we reconstructed the L4A product for this region and South America, using the corresponding expressions to estimate AGBD. The results show an improvement in the overall correlation and a reduction in errors, with RMSE reducing to 68.4 Mg/h for South American ENF and 64.2 Mg/h for North American ENF. Finally, we discuss ways to improve AGBD estimations (or flag wrong ones) using all available values of the rh curve.
