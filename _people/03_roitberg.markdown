description: "(he/him) contributes strong expertise in data science, specializing in the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to environmental challenges. He also has experience in the financial sector and in applying artificial intelligence to healthcare problems. His Ph.D. research focused on near-real-time deforestation detection using optical remote sensing combined with advanced machine learning models. His current roles as Senior Data Scientist and consultant emphasize methodological rigor in data analysis and the practical application of machine learning approaches. As an Adjunct Professor in the Data Science program at UNSAM, he designed and launched the university’s first Introduction to Machine Learning course, creating the syllabus, lectures, and assignments from scratch—and is now doing the same for the Advanced Machine Learning course."
