description: "Satellite-based Oil Spill Detection in Optically Complex Waters: A Feasibility Study for Argentina. Oil spills significantly impact the environment, local economies, and coastal communities. Effective monitoring and rapid response are critical, particularly in regions with extensive coastlines and heavy maritime traffic. Argentina, with its vast Atlantic coast and busy ports, such as Buenos Aires, La Plata, and Bahía Blanca, faces unique challenges due to frequent maritime routes and optically complex turbid waters like the Río de la Plata estuary.
